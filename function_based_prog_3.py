What is a Function/Method? Aspirant's response
Reusable Block of code to do some specific task when ever we call and it can be kept in a centralized program
Group of predefined codes that can be used for performing multiple tasks
Reduce the code complexity and easy to understand
How we can call a function -> Concurrently, Parallely, Distributedly, Recursively

#FUNCTION BASED PROGRAMMING (Python is a pure FBP Language, Python treats Functions as first class citizen)
#What? Function/Method is a stored program that perform specific/set of tasks

#Why we need to create Functions or why we need FBP -
#1. Functions can be created once and reused multiple times - reduced complexity, reduced LOC, Precise/simple/ease of understanding, Maintainable
#2. Functions are used to call/run in a parallel (I have 1000 rows, running a function in 10 parallel threads with each thread handles 100 rows)
# and in concurrent fashion (I am calling a single function at the sametime from 10 diffent applications/programs)
# and extend FBP to achieve distributed parallelism also
#single thread - a function run with only one instance(copy) on a given task sequencially.
#parallelism - a function run with multiple instance(copy) on a given task parallely but to some extend.
#concurrently - a function can be called by different applications at the same time.
#distributed parallelism - a function run with multiple instance(copy) on a given task distributed & parallely to any extend (leveraging the power of cluster).
#3. Functions help us reduce the LOC by reusing and by composing
#4. Functions are used for creating Application or Organization specific Reusable Frameworks
# (Masking FW, DMA FW, Metricbot, DQ FW, DQaaS, Datacurra, DAAF etc.,)
# Generic Frameworks (Spark/Airflow/glue/great expectation/deeque)
# or custom functionalities (udf, custom functions, Cloud functions) or
# centralized functionalities (If we change the function in one place, that affects the entire consuming applications of the given functions
# eg. change in bonus calculation in one place)

#Benifits/Features of Functions in Function Based Programming or Why FBP?
#I have Function/Method created called Fun
#1. Concurrency - Calling the method/function "Fun" at the same time from multiple different applications/programs
#2. MultiThreading/Parallelism - Running (Multiple threads/instances to divide the workload evenly in a single computer) of the method/function "Fun" at the same time by multiple different applications/programs or a single appication
#3. Distributed (parallelism) function call - Running (Multiple threads/instances to divide the workload evenly in a cluster) of the method/function "Fun" at the same time across different computers
#4. Simple/Elegant - Program created once and reused, easily maintained, reduced LOC, ease of usage.

#FBP â€“ Characteristics
#In Python functions are first class citizens, that means functions are given equal priority as like variables or a variable can be treated as a function
a_var=10#a variable can hold value
class cls1():
    pass
a_obj=cls1()#a variable can refer a program in the memory (object)
a_function=lambda x:x*x#a variable can hold or act as a function
print("square root of 10 is ",a_function(10))

#Functions are composable - to achive complex output, we don't have to create a complex function rather we can call/compose simple functions
data={"id":1,"name":"mohamed irfan"}
print(len(data.get("name").split(" ")[0]))#5 functions i composed to get the length of the first name, because there is no single function available to achive this...
#data.get("name").split(" ")[0].__len__()

#Functions are not time bounded (stateless or no side effect) - We can call functions any number of times
#Below anonymous code is a time bounded (call the same logic will vary based on how many times you call)
a=1
if a>0:
    a+=2
    print("1",a)

if a>0:
    a+=2
    print("2",a)

if a>0:
    a+=2
    print("3",a)

#If i convert the above code into a function, it will become non time bounded (call the function any time the result will not vary)
def fun1():
    a=1
    if a>0:
        a+=2
        print(a)

fun1()#1

#All about Functions or Methods in FBP - syntactically...
###################################################
#1. How to Create a function and call a function (High level)
#1. Minimal/least way of creating a method
#Minimum we can create a function with def keyword followed by function name followed by () followed by : followed by body code of a function
def fundamental_fun():
    print("function is called")

fundamental_fun()

#2. Regular/Optimal/typical/formal way of creating a method
def complete_function_syntax_symantics(a:int,b:int):
    '''This function will help us add the input parameters and return the sum of those 2'''
    c=a+b
    #print(c)
    return c

#We need to have a def keyword (definition of a function) - (mandatory) any function/method creation has to have starting with def keyword
#followed by the function name - (mandatory), lower case with underscores or just lowercase words
#followed by argument(s) - optional
# with datatype mentioned (to hint us understand the datatype signature of the method)- optional
# mentioned inside the brackets() - mandatory
#followed by ':' (completion of the definition) - mandatory
#followed by - some description in ''' , to display the methods description when hover - optional
#followed by the body of the program (one/multiple lines of code - core logics + std output + return) - mandatory with atleast 1 line
#followed by return keyword - (optional) where as return help us send back result to the calling environment

#3. What are the possible way of creating functions/methods
#all permutation and combination works...
#a.Method with no input arguments and no return - eg. exit used in hive or set hive.cli.print.header;

#4. How do we call the Methods:
def add_vals(a:int,b:int):
    '''add the 2 input params'''
    c=a+b
    #print(c)
    return c

#How to call the above function
add_vals(10,20)#it runs, but of no use since no print or no return

#How to just print the output of a function
add_vals(10,20)#it runs, meaningful if we have print in it..

#How to store the output of a method and use that output/return value further as an input to other functions
return_val=add_vals(10,20)#it runs, meaningful if we have return in it..
operating_on_the_return=return_val+100
print(return_val)

#Simple usecase:
# a. Complete the Swiggy/zomato usecase (anonymous program) by creating a formal reusable method/function
# b. and add exception handling also in it..

#5. How to create & call the methods using different Argument types: Important part
##############################################################################
#Different type of methods/functions arguments are there -
# positional arg func, named/keyword arg func, default arg func, arbitrary arg func, keyword arbitrary argument function
#Irfan, Are you declare the arg with dtattype?
#i am hinting the argument with the type

#Different arguments methdologies of calling this functions:
#A. Positional arguments methods
#table (id int,name string) -> insert into table values(1,'irfan') #positional
final_sal=calc_sal_bonus(10000,20,1500)#Passing the arguments based on the position
print(final_sal)
final_sal=calc_sal_bonus(20,10000,1500)#Passing the arguments not based on the position (result with wrong values)

final_sal_IT=calc_sal_bonus(bon=10,sal=10000,inc=1500)#Passing the arguments not based on the position but based on name/keyword works

#c. Default arguments methods - If the function is not called with enough argument values, then default value can be used

#6. Special Types of Methods/Functions in Python - Is not much important for creating/implementing the methods by Dataengineers,
#but for understanding the type of methods/functions used in the framework, the below learning is useful.
# FBP (special methods) - Higher Order Function, Anonymous/lambda/function literal/value function,Closures, recursive functions/tail recursion
# OOPs (special methods)- instance (default), class,static methods
print("**********Special Types of Methods/Functions in Python - Important (interview purpose)***************")
#a. Higher Order Functions - Top priority
print("Benifits of HOF1 -> 1. We can use the functions seperately or along with other functions "
      "2. Rather than rewriting the code in a given function we can reuse it by passing the function as an argument ")


#Realtime example : Calculate the salary of our employees based on working days

#How to convert the above method into HOF and what is the benifits of doing it?

print(f"HR Sending a mail to the supervisor about the days the given employee didn't worked for a given month ")

#Usecase to understand HOF1: Create a calculator method that should take add/sub/mul/div method as an input argument

print("b. Closures Functions")
print("What is closure? If the result of a given method is changed/affected by the value defined outside of the given function ")

#Usecase Can you create a method called calc_sal_bonus_incentive using a higher order method and closure concepts?

print("c. Lambda Function - A function created anonymously or a function as a variable using lambda keyword")
#Lambda functions can be called as function literal/anonymous function/value function
#Interview Question: Diff between methods & functions -
# Method: Any functionalities/store program created with def keyword (syntactically)

# Method: Can be used for some common, complex (logic can be in multiple lines) functionality purposes across the modules of an application

# Function: Any simple functionalities/store program created with lambda keyword (syntactically)

# Function: Can be used for some anonymous/adhoc, simple (logic should not be in multiple lines) functionality purposes within the given module, not across the module


print("d. Recursive Function or tail recursion - A function called by itself repeatedly or recursively")

#Realtime example of Recursive Function? SIP, FD, Complex Interest (interest for interest)
#I am investing 100000 rupees with an return of 10% year over year, after 3 years what is my return?
#100000 -> 100000+10000=110000 (year1) -> 110000+11000=121000 (year2) -> 121000+12100=133100 (year3)

#Lets write the above function in a single recursive function



#7. Scope of Variables in Functions/Methods - Local and Global variable
print("7. Scope of Variables in Functions/Methods - Local and Global variable")
